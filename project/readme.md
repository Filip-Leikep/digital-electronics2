## Theoretical description and explanation
The goal of this project was to design an embedded system which would use Arduino UNO board together with other external modules to create an automatic plant watering system. The modules which were used are air humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor and a module with RTC and EEPROM. An LCD panel is attached to display time, air humidity and soil moisture value.
